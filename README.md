# life-builder
This apptlication is based on "remastersys" and creates an ISO file from the running system.
The GUI is written in Python and QT.
The Bash Script can also be used without GUI.

It allows to include the complete user configuration in the live system and use the live system as installer device.

Tested with KDE Neon 16.04 but should work with most Ubuntu derivates.

#

In combination with "life-usbcreator" it can prepare the live usb device directly after creating the image.
All "life" applications need to be copied to ~/.life/applications/ for now in order to work properly
