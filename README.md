# life-builder
This apptlication is based on "remastersys" and creates an ISO file from the running system.
The GUI is written in Python and QT.
The Bash Script can also be used without GUI.

It allows to include the complete user configuration (backup mode) in the live system and use the live system as installer device.
The finalised ISO Image can be tested directly in KVM or "burned" to a USB device.
life-usbcreator is included in this application.

Tested with KDE Neon 16.04 but should work with most Ubuntu derivates. (minor adjustments needed)

#

All "life" applications need to be copied to ~/.life/applications/ for now in order to work properly
